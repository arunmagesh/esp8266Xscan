Extensive Wifi Scanner using ESP8266/NodeMCU

I am not going to go deep on how to install Arduino or NodeMCU or ESP8266. Lot of resource is already available in big G

in short:
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Install ESP8266 board from Board manager
3. Copy this code and upload it to the board.
4. Open Serial console at 115200 and watch the thing scanning WiFis


This code is modified version of ESP8266 WiFi Scan example. 
Credits to everyone from ESP8266 and Arduino.
